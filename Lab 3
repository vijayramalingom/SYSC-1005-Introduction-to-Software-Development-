#Exercise 1
#Step 1
print 3.14*5**2

#Step 2
def area_of_disk(radius):
    return 3.14*radius**2

#Step 3
print area_of_disk(5.0)
#The value is the same area as displayed in Step 1

#Step 4 Predict the area will be 314.0 
print area_of_disk(10.0)
#Result is as predicted

#Step 5
print area_of_disk(2.0 + 3.0)
r = 2.0 + 3.0
print area_of_disk(r)
print area_of_disk(r * 2)

#Step 6
result = area_of_disk(5.0)
print result

#Step 7
#Global Frame
#Refers to the function
#area_of_disk
#at step 2
#radius is bound to 5.0 since we put 5.0 = radius in the function call
#depicts it as a float 
#after the result has been bound
#the global frame
#after the function definition had been excecuted
#function definition and argument caused result to be bound to 5.0
